- [x] Click pipeline from tree view
- [x] Click pipeline from navbar
- [x] Create new pipeline
- [x] Navigate between stages using top bar

### ✅ Stage-Specific Tests
- [x] RFQ - Add/View/Edit/Delete
- [x] Feasibility - Accept/Reject/View/Edit
- [x] Quotation - Add/View/Edit with subdeals
- [x] Negotiation - View/Edit with events
- [x] Pre-Process - View/Edit with timelines
- [x] Post-Process - View/Edit

## Technical Details

### Required Imports
```typescript
import { useParams } from "next/navigation";

// Get pipelineId in component
const params = useParams();
const pipelineId = params?.pipelineId as string;
```

### Navigation Pattern
```typescript
// Correct
router.push(`/crm/pipelines/${pipelineId}/stage/${itemId}`);

// Incorrect (old pattern)
router.push(`/crm/pipelines/stage/${itemId}`);
```

2. ✅ **Pipeline Isolation** - Each pipeline's data is separate
3. ✅ **Better UX** - Clear visual navigation with stage bar
4. ✅ **Mobile Support** - Responsive dropdown for mobile devices
5. ✅ **Progress Tracking** - Visual indicator of pipeline progress
6. ✅ **Consistent Navigation** - All pages follow same pattern
7. ✅ **Sub-Pipeline Support** - Works with hierarchical pipelines
